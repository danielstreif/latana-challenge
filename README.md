# Latana Coding Challenge

The aim of this challenge was to build a carousel component according to a design brief. Furthermore, the component should match the overall design of the Latana website. I decided to implement the carousel as a React component and used Create React App for the basic setup.

## Getting Started with Create React App

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

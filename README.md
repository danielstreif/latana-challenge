# Latana Coding Challenge

The aim of this challenge was to build a carousel component according to a design brief. Furthermore, the component should match the overall design of the Latana website. I decided to implement the carousel as a React component and used Create React App for the basic setup. The content.json file contains information about the slides to display and can be altered accordingly. Depending on the screen size there will be three, two or one slide visible at a time. Breakpoints are currently set at 1342px for medium screens and 982px for small screens. 

## Getting Started with Create React App

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
